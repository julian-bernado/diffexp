# Investigating Differential Expression by Sex and Brain Region

## To-Do
1. Settle how we're dealing with language differences
2. Set a meeting time for Monday, Sep 23rd. Probably afternoon?

## The Project

### The Objective
For both the differential conditions of sex and brain region (ACC vs. DLFPC), find 20 genes of interest and report the reliability of our findings.

### The Data
30 tissue samples taken from:
* 10 recently deceased individuals
* 5 males
* 5 females
3 brain regions
* Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
* Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
* Cerebellum

for a total of 30 tissue samples assayed at 3 labs. Each of the 30 tissue samples were portioned into 3 aliquots and sent to labs at

* UC Davis
* UC Irvine
* University of Michigan

for a total of 90 microarrays. Note: 6 of the 90 didn't pass quality control, so we only have data for 84. The microarrays were produced by Affymetrix in two slightly different versions.

* HG U95A
* HG U95Av2
* Only genes that appear on both versions are retained in the dataset.
* 12,600 genes.
* 
Note: technically, probesets not genes, and some are controls.
