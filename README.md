# Investigating Differential Expression by Sex and Brain Region

## The Project

### The Objective
The main goal of this project was to investigate the differences in gene expression levels between various groups of brain cells. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns that might inform deeper biological understanding.

### The Data

#### Background
This project utilized microarray data from brain cells, focusing on gene expression levels. The analysis covered various genes and brain regions, aiming to discern expression patterns. The central dogma of molecular biology (DNA → RNA → Protein) provided the scientific backdrop, emphasizing gene transcription and translation.

#### Data Facts
- **Gene Expression Data**: The project involved a matrix of gene expression levels, with 84 samples and 12,600 genes measured. Each row represented a sample from a brain cell, and each column represented a gene.
- **Microarray Technology**: Microarray chips measured the mRNA expression levels of genes, providing insights into which genes were active in particular cell types.
- **Brain Regions**: Samples were taken from different brain regions, allowing for comparative analysis.
- **Patients and Samples**: The dataset included patient-specific data, along with microarray version and brain region source.
